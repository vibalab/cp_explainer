          First, generate points randomly to fill an ellipse with a 3:2 ratio.
          For the network connecting nodes based on title similarity, perform
          community detection using the{" "}
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louvain_method">
            Louvain algorithm
          </a>
          . For each community, set the animation with the highest *rank as the
          representative value. Starting with the highest-ranked community,
          place the nodes sequentially from the center to the periphery.

            Node Size
          </span>
          <br /> The nodes are sized based on their popularity, segmented into
          the top 30, 100, 1000, and the remaining nodes, from a total of 2000
          nodes. <br />

            Node Color
          </span>
          <br /> The colors of the nodes represent the size of the cluster each
          node belongs to (number of works in the same series). Series with more
          than 6 works are shown in dark purple, series with more than 1 work
          are shown in purple, and individual works are displayed in light
          purple. <br />

            Node Image

          <br /> The image inserted into the node signifies that the animation
          has either won an award (crown) or is ranked within the Top 5.

          The first part of each animationâ€™s title, split based on the colon,
          was embedded using a pre-trained language model. Cosine similarity was
          calculated between the embeddings; nodes with high similarity were
          connected, while those with relatively lower similarity were connected
          only if they were produced by the same studio. Connections were not
          made if the cosine similarity was below 0.7. This approach illustrates
          the connections between animations within the same series.

          <span style={{ fontWeight: "bold", color: "#6E58FF" }}>Synopsis</span>

          Pretrained sentence embedding is applied, and nodes are connected if
          the cosine similarity is 0.65 or higher.

          Sentence embedding is applied to the studio names, connecting nodes
          with a cosine similarity of 0.85 or higher.

          <br />
          <span style={{ fontWeight: "bold", color: "#6E58FF" }}>Genre</span>
          <br />
          Genres are one-hot encoded, and nodes are connected if they have
          identical genre vectors.

      We developed an interactive visualization system using Sigma.js and React
      to represent anime networks based on a dataset from{" "}
      <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dbdmobile/myanimelist-dataset">
        Kaggle Anime Dataset 2023
      </a>
      . This filtered dataset includes animations and production companies from
      1961 to 2023, allowing us to visualize relationships between different
      animations or production companies.
      <br />
      <br />
      We applied various Machine Learning and Deep Learning algorithms to the
      Node and Edge Attributes of the data. This approach provides additional
      insights that are not immediately apparent from the dataset alone,
      enabling a deeper understanding of the connections and patterns within the
      anime industry.
      <br />
      <br />
      The "Animation" network represents the relationships between different
      animations, while the "Studios" network illustrates the connections
      between studios, licensors, and producers. This distinction allows users
      to explore specific aspects of the anime industry in more detail.
